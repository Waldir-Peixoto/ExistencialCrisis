    <h1>Why i decided to change my carrear? Why computer science?</h1>

<p>Well! I am in my thirties! this is a age envolted in mistery! For some reason, for the majority of men is a age where we started searching for Harley Davidson's motocycles and leather jackets on the internet, and a age where we start to question our actual job and state of life! Some profound questions start to pop out? What's the meaning of life? Why i didn't partyed more? I believe that is a new type of puberty!(I sugest the scientists to look for the answer os this questions in hormonal changes!) 
In another times this change in mentality and fluctuations could be easily descarted, but not nowadays! For those of you that are too young, the times are ever changing and full of oportunitys, but those borned on the 80's, as me, were acostumed with times where the jobs were stable, and on his 30's, a man should have a well stablished job wich he or she would stay until old age, have children and family. On this scenery the existencial crisis should be put in a corner of mind and be satisfied with a conversible car or a motocycle.
Nowadays, the times are changing in a unbelivible way! My original plan was to be a judge or a prosecutor, but as i read the news and the science prospects i realize that this kind of job is losing it's meaning as time pass. 
On my actual job, as a legal assistant in a Federal Prosecutor Office, we already have a artificial inteligency capable of writing legal "parecerys" on habeas corpus. Looking at the constant evolution on Machine Learning i can't deny that the funcion of a judge, a tradicional profession dating of hundred's of years prior is nearing it's end.
I found myself on a turning point, or i enjoy my crisis and make good use of it to change completely my convictions, plans and way of life, or i am "fadado" to obsolescence as a human being. 
This are new ages. As a human, we need to change. To those that were born in this changing times the new ways are easy to follow, but to us this change require a certain voluntary mental breakdown. Destroy and reborn. 
I choose Science Computer because is a completely different area of knowledge wich i am habituated. I don't know if programmers will remain indispensible on the future years to come (if even death is uncertain to the singularity believers), but i know that the primordial ability and skill required to humans beings in this times and on the future is the ability to change. To be a joker! So I took the task of ever ending change as a new hobby! This resume the answer to the question above. Now i will go to sleep! (i worked all day, so i am dead tired) </p>
