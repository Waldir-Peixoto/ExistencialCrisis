        <h2>CoronaVírus</h2>
        <p>While i am writing this, there is an outbreak of a vírus on the whole world! I am being obligated to stay at home with my wife, son, nephew, cat and mother-in-law. Whithout stoping my work (Home Office mode-on). On this days, with the impending
            economic crisis that this quarantine will surely bring, my project of learning a different profession became more urgent. I remembered this blog, wich i already had forgoten and decided to continue the writing and learning of HTML, CSS and
            Javascript. Well, on this day, i realize that the world will pass for many changes. The workplace, for instance, will migrate for a Home Office preference, avoiding future paralisies en case a differente virus take place. One thing is for
            sure, the tecnology area will grow. Virtual Reality, Artificial Inteligence and other areas of Computacional Science will experience a boom, what make me realize that my original choice was not wrong. The future of humankind is in Tecnology.
            Our new and universal language will be binary. I can not stay put, while the whole world change, or i will stay behind and obsolete. Writen in 13/06/2020.

        <h1>Why i decided to change my carrer? Why computer science?</h1>

        <p>Well! I am in my thirties! this is a age envolted in mistery! For some reason, for the majority of men is a age where we started searching for Harley Davidson's motocycles and leather jackets on the internet, and a age where we start to question
            our actual job and state of life! Some profound questions start to pop out? What's the meaning of life? Why i didn't partyed more? I believe that is a new type of puberty!(I sugest the scientists to look for the answer os this questions in
            hormonal changes!) In another times this change in mentality and fluctuations could be easily descarted, but not nowadays! For those of you that are too young, the times are ever changing and full of oportunitys, but those borned on the 80's,
            as me, were acostumed with times where the jobs were stable, and on his 30's, a man should have a well stablished job wich he or she would stay until old age, have children and family. On this scenery the existencial crisis should be put in
            a corner of mind and be satisfied with a conversible car or a motocycle. Nowadays, the times are changing in a unbelievible way! My original plan was to be a judge or a prosecutor, but as i read the news and the science prospects i realize
            that this kind of job is losing it's meaning as time pass. On my actual job, as a legal assistant in a Federal Prosecutor Office, we already have a artificial inteligency capable of writing legal "parecerys" on habeas corpus. Looking at the
            constant evolution on Machine Learning i can't deny that the funcion of a judge, a tradicional profession dating of hundred's of years prior is nearing it's end. I found myself on a turning point, or i enjoy my crisis and make good use of
            it to change completely my convictions, plans and way of life, or i am "fadado" to obsolescence as a human being. This are new ages. As a human, we need to change. To those that were born in this changing times the new ways are easy to follow,
            but to us this change require a certain voluntary mental breakdown. Destroy and reborn. I choose Science Computer because is a completely different area of knowledge wich i am habituated. I don't know if programmers will remain indispensible
            on the future years to come (if even death is uncertain to the singularity believers), but i know that the primordial ability and skill required to humans beings in this times and on the future is the ability to change. To be a joker! So I
            took the task of ever ending change as a new hobby! This resume the answer to the question above. Now i will go to sleep! (i worked all day, so i am dead tired) Writen in 10/02/2020.</p>
